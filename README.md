# Collection of my keyboards

build process highly inspired by a bogpost about [separate keymap repo for qmk](https://medium.com/@patrick.elmquist/separate-keymap-repo-for-qmk-136ff5a419bd).
It uses [task](https://taskfile.dev) instead of make to automate the compile process.

## Todo:
- use user config for common keymap
- draw keyboard layout with [keymap-drawer](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer)
- fix build for older (handwired) keyboards
